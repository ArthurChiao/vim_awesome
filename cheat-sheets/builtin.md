<a id="save_quit"></a>
## [[↑]](#top) Open, Save, Quit/Close files

1. Basic

    | Command  |  Action |
    | :-------- |  :--------- |
    | vim -R `<file>` | open file in READ ONLY mode |
    | vim -p `<file1> <file2>` | open multiple files, in differrent tabs |
    | :w   | save |

    This command is useful when you changed a file and are saving it, but are
    warned that you have no priviledge to modify it. It saves the changes with
    root previleages:

    ```shell
    :w !sudo tee %
   
    # the alias in current configuration is W
    :W        # same as `:w !sudo tee %`
    ```

## [[↑]](#top) Code Folding

Large source files, e.g. thousands of lines, are inconvenient for reading.
Code folding can be a great help on this point.

It is convenient to temporarily fold away (hide) parts of your file,
leaving only an outline of the major parts visible. This is what folding does.

* **For C/C++/JavaScript files** `:set foldmethod=syntax` (or use `setlocal`: `:setlocal foldmethod=syntax`, same for below)
* **For Python/HTML files** `:set foldmethod=indent`

1. Basic

    | Command | Action |
    | :-------- |  :--------- |
    | `zf` | create folding on visual selected block |
    | `za` | toggle to unfold/fold current folding |
    | `zc` | close a fold at the cursor |
    | `zr` | open all first-level folds in file |
    | `zm` | closes all first-level folds in file |
    | `zR` | open all folds in file |
    | `zM` | closes all open folds in file |

    This is a folding command list picked up
    from [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23579058/vim-python-mode-folding):

    | Command | Action |
    | :-------- |  :--------- |
    | zf`<num>`j | creates a fold from the cursor down `num` lines, e.g. `zf3j` |
    | zf/string | creates a fold from the cursor to string  |
    | `zj` | moves the cursor to the next fold |
    | `zk` | moves the cursor to the previous fold |
    | zo | opens a fold at the cursor |
    | zO | opens all folds at the cursor |
    | `zd` | deletes the fold at the cursor |
    | `zE` | deletes all folds |
    | [z | move to start of open fold |
    | ]z | move to end of open fold |

    by the way, I also found that `h` or `l` will unfold the code when cursor
    is at one folding, so my frequently used keys are

    * `h` or `l` or `za`: unfold current folding
    * `zc` or `za`: fold/re-fold
    * `zR` and `zM`: open/close all folds in current file

    If you'd like to create new fold manually, first set `foldmethod` to `manual`:
    ```shell
    # set foldmethod to manul in vim
    :set foldmethod=manual

    # select text/code and create fold with `zf`
    zf
    ```
    otherwise, you will get error like this:

    > E350: Cannot create fold with current 'foldmethod'

1. Advanced

    | Command | Action |
    | :-------- |  :--------- |
    | zm | increases the foldlevel by one |
    | zr | decreases the foldlevel by one |
    | z+ | page down |
    | z. | redraw window, put current line in the middle of the screen |

<a id="insert_add"></a>

## [[↑]](#top) Insert/Add

1. Basic

    | Command  |  Action |
    | :-------- |  :--------- |
    | i    | insert at current cursor  |
    | I    | insert before first non-blank character of current line  |
    | a    | (append) insert after current character |
    | A    | (append) insert at the end of this line |
    | o    | insert new line below this line |
    | O    | insert new line uppper this line |
    | `ctl-c` | exit insert mode, same affect as stroking `ESC` |

1. Advanced

    Some advanced insertions, e.g, insert same context at same position of
    multiple lines with help of `block selection`:

    | Command  |  Action |
    | :-------- |  :--------- |
    | `ctl + v`  `I`   | `ctl + v` (block selection), `I` (insert before selected block)   |
    | :read `<file>` | read the specified file, insert content into current file |
    | `:$read <file>` | append file to the end of current file |
    | `:0read <file>` | pre-append file to the beginning of current file |
    | `:<N1>,<N2>write` <file> | write text between line `<N1>` and `<N2>` to file, e.g. `:10,200w a.txt` |
    | `:.,$write <file>` | write text from current line to the end to file |
    | `:.write <file>` | write text of current line to file, e.g. `:.w a.txt` |
    | `:.write >> <file>` | append text of current line to file, e.g. `:.w >> a.txt` |
    | `:.,$write! <file>` | force to write it |

1. Read/Write Advanced

    | Command  |  Action |
    | :-------- |  :--------- |
    | `:read !<shell_command>` | execute shell command `<shell_command>>`, paste the result after cursor, e.g `:r !ls -ahl`, `:r !tree` |
    | `:0read !<shell_command>` | insert context before beginning of current file |

1. Special Commands in Inserting Mode

    | Command  |  Action | Comments |
    | :-------- |  :--------- | :------ |
    | `ctl-w` | delete a WORD before cursor, like shell command `ctl-w` | same effect as `ESC` + `db` |
    | `ctl-u` | delete all words before cursor, like shell command `ctl-u` |

1. Insert `""` / `''` / `{}` / `[]` / `()` around code block

    | Command  |  Action | Comments |
    | :-------- |  :--------- | :------ |
    | `$e` | add `""` between visual selected code block | |
    | `$$` | same as `$e` ||
    | `$q` | add `''` (single quotes) between visual selected code block | |
    | `$1` | add `()` between visual selected code block | |
    | `$2` | add `[]` between visual selected code block | |
    | `$3` | add `{}` between visual selected code block | |

    E.g. the following code:

    ```python
    print hello
    ```

    Command `fhve$e` turns it to `print "hello"`:

    ```python
    print "hello"
    ```

    Explanations: `fh` moves cursor to `h` of `hello`, `ve` visual selects word
    `hello`, `$e` adds `""` around the word.


<a id="substitute_replace"></a>
## [[↑]](#top) Substitute/Replace

1. Basic

    Difference between `substitute` and `replace` is that `substitute` enters
    `edit mode` from `command mode`, while `replace` stays in `command mode`.

    | Command  |  Action |
    | :-------- |  :--------- |
    | s    | substitute current character (with one or more characters) |
    | S    | substitute current line |
    | r    | replace current character |
    | R    | replace remaining of current line (start from cursor position) |
    | C    | change remaining of current line (same as `Da`) |
    | `i ctl-u` | change contents before cursor of current line |
    | :s/old/new/    | substitute 'new' for the first matching 'old'(in current line) |

    | x | dl | delete one char (forward) |
    | X | dh | delete one char (backward) |
    | D | d$ | delete remaing of current line |
    | C | c$ | change remaining of current line |
    | s | cl | substitute/change one char |

    | `:/\<the`  | search strings start with `the` in current file |

1. search in text

    search all the occurrances of word `session`, the effect is similar as
    linux command `grep`:

    see [this list for a full vi builtin key bindings](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/vi.html).

    **Highly recommended!**

1. **Powerful but seldomly knowns**

    `f/F` `t/T` jumps to the specified character in current line, in
    forward/backward direction.

    `;` and `,` repeat the last jumping, each in
    forward and backward directions.

    | Command  |  Action |
    | :------- | :-------- |
    | `f<CHAR>`  | find `CHAR` after cursor in current line, e.g. `fa`: jump to first `a` in current line, `3fa` jumps to the 3rd `a` |
    | `F<CHAR>`  | find `CHAR` before cursor in current line |
    | ; | repeat last `f`, `F`, `t`, `T` command, e.g, `fa;;` is equal to `3fa`, `fa;,` is equal to `2fa` |
    | `t<CHAR>`  | similar with `f<CHAR>` but the cursor will be located before `CHAR` |
    | `T<CHAR>`  | search backward |
    | g; | go the last changed/edited position |

    Combining with other operations, e.g.

    * `df"`: **deleting util next `"` char**
    * `cfl`: **changing/subtituting content util next `l` char**

    Amazing! A whole new world emerges!

<a id="screen_scroll"></a>

1. Advanced (**Cool!**)

    | Command  |  Action |
    | :------- | :-------- |
    | `ctl-e` | one line up (Extra), same effect as `ctl-l` + `j` |
    | `ctl-y` | one line down , same effect as `ctl-h` + `k`|

    `ctl-e` and `ctl-y` move the screen content one line up/down, while
    keeping the cursor still in its position.

    | Command  |  Action |
    | :------- | :-------- |
    | caw | **change a (the) word** under cursor |
    | ciw | same as `caw`, but white spaces will be skipped |


<a id="copy_paste"></a>

## [[↑]](#top) Copy/Paste

1. Basic

    `c` has been occupied in vim which stands for **Change**, so copy in vim
    is denoted as `y`, short for **Yanking**.

    | Command  |  Action |

<a id="buffer"></a>
## [[↑]](#top) Vim Buffer

    `:ls` - list all the files in vim buffer, one file each buffer. This is
    especially usuful in that you can see the files edited in other process by
    vim, e.g, you edited `1.txt` in bash1, save and quit. Then in bash2, you
    opened a new file `2.txt` with vim. By executing `:ls` in the vim, you could
    see `1.txt` in the buffer, and you could edit it in this bash now.

    * `:mksession! ~/.mysession.vim` - force to save
    * `vim -S ~/.mysession.vim` - open saved session, which contains the status the last time vim exited

<a id="quickfix"></a>
## [[↑]](#top) Quickfix

1. Basic

    Vim has a special mode to speedup the edit-compile-edit cycle.  This is
    inspired by the quickfix option of the Manx's Aztec C compiler on the Amiga.
    The idea is to **save the error messages from the compiler in a file and use Vim
    to jump to the errors one by one**.  You can examine each problem and fix it,
    without having to remember all the error messages.

    In Vim the quickfix commands are used more generally to find a list of
    positions in files.  For example, `:vimgrep` finds pattern matches.  You can
    use the positions in a script with the `getqflist()` function.  Thus you can
    do a lot more than the edit/compile/fix cycle!

    ```shell
    # e.g. we are editing and compiling test.cc
    :make # compiling test.cc by executing makefile
    :cw or :cwindow # open a subwindow in vim, list all the compiling errors in it
                    # you can now see the errors and the source code simultaneously
    # some commands
    :cp - go to previous error place
    :cn - go to next error place
    :cl - list all errors
    :cc - list the details of the error

    # another example
    grep -R test_func * # search all appearances of string `test_func` from current
                        # folder recursively
    :cw # vim command, load all the appearances (line number and the line) in subwindow
    ```
