This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2943

This is a new version from JumpInCode.vim I don't know why i can't upload a new version to the old JumpInCode page (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2770)? So I start this branch

ctags and cscope plugin for vim, more convenice way to use ctags and cscope in vim

Command:
\sy   Generate tags and cscope database from current directory
\sc   Configure window (Take care of the help info the window below)

Sample_1:
    :e your_source_.h
    :cd %:p:h
    \sy
    <Enter>
    :EnQuickSnippet
    :CscopeCtagsMenu

Sample_2:
    :cd d:\
    \sc
    <Select your database and input enter>
    :EnQuickSnippet
    :CscopeCtagsMenu


Suggestion:
    1. <Leader>sy is default script command, if it conflict with your other script you can change it at line 753 of script.
    2. <Leader>sy is default script command, if it conflict with your other script you can change it at line 754 of script.
    3. Command CscopeCtagsMenu, EnQuickSnippet, DiQuickSnippet are not mapped, for convenient way is map it to your own command in your .vimrc or _vimrc file.
    4. If your are using gvim on window, CscopeCtagsMenu is pretty help to view source code.
    5. This script is better work with script: taglist ( http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273 )
    6. This script is better work with script: MRU  ( http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273 )
    7. This script is better work with script: Mark  ( http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1238 )
    8. This script is better work with script: NERDTree ( http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1658 )

Update (4.0.0)
    1. Fix some bug in the old script, and add some new function in gvim.
    2. Add command EnQuickSnippet and DiquickSnippet. This is a better way to use ctags, Now vim is working pretty like sourceinside, specially on windows givm.

Tips:
    1. CscopeCtagsMenu command maybe not wok on linux or cygwin terminal, this is for windows gvim.
    2. Friends help docs is not finished yet. If you have any problem with script or any suggestion, please click here http://groups.google.com/group/ccvext?msg=new&lnk=gcis or email me thatway.c@gmail.com
