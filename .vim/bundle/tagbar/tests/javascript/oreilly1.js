function Circle(radius) {   // the constructor defines the class itself
    // r is an instance variable; defined and initialized in the constructor
    this.r = radius;    
}

// Circle.PI is a class variable--it is a property of the constructor function
Circle.PI = 3.14159;

// Here is a function that computes a circle area.
function Circle_area() { return Circle.PI * this.r * this.r; }

// to the prototype object of the constructor.  Remember that we have to

// Here's another function.  It takes two circle objects are arguments and
// returns the one that is larger (has the larger radius).  
function Circle_max(a,b) {
    if (a.r > b.r) return a;
    else return b;
}

// Since this function compares two circle objects, it doesn't make sense as 
// an instance method operating on a single circle object.  But we don't want
// it to be a stand-alone function either, so we make it into a class method
// by assigning it to the constructor function:
Circle.max = Circle_max;

// Here is some code that uses each of these fields:
c = new Circle(1.0);       // create an instance of the Circle class
c.r = 2.2;                 // set the r instance variable
a = c.area();              // invoke the area() instance method 
x = Math.exp(Circle.PI);   // use the PI class variable in our own computation.
d = new Circle(1.2);       // create another Circle instance
bigger = Circle.max(c,d);  // use the max() class method.
