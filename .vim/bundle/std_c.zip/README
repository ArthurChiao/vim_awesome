This C syntax file is to help developing portable Standard C code.  That is C code that has to be able to compile on many different compilers.  The default is to highlight C89 C code, but it can be configured to allow or flag as an error C94 and C99 language features (types, constants, etc.)

Additional non-standard C features can be allowed - C++ comments, GNU C keywords, $ in identitfiers for VMS C, etc.

The syntax file also has the following benefits:

o more language elements highlighted (e.g. function and identifier names)
o more syntax errors highlighted, and
o better highlighting of macros.

Details of all configuration options are documented in the supplied help file.
