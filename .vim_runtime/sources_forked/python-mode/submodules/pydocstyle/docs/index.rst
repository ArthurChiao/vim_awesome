pydocstyle's documentation
==========================

**pydocstyle** is a static analysis tool for checking compliance with Python
docstring conventions.

**pydocstyle** supports most of
`PEP 257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ out of the box, but it
should not be considered a reference implementation.

**pydocstyle** supports Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and pypy.
