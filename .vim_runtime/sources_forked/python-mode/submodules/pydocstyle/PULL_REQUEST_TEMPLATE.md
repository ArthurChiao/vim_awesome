Thanks for submitting a PR!

Please make sure to check for the following items:
- [ ] Add unit tests and integration tests where applicable.  
      If you've added a error code or changed an error code behavior, 
      you should probably add or change a test case file under `tests/test_cases/` and add 
      it to the list under `tests/test_definitions.py`.  
      If you've added or changed a command line option,
      you should probably add or change a test in `tests/test_integration.py`.
- [ ] Add a line to the release notes (docs/release_notes.rst) under "Current Development Version".  
      Make sure to include the PR number after you open and get one.
   
Please don't get discouraged as it may take a while to get a review.
