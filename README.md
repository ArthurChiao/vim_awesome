# About

My vim configuration, originally derived from
[amix's project](https://github.com/amix/vimrc).

# Supported Platforms
This configuration is best suitable for vim **7.4+**. However, it could also
be used with vim under this version - just disable those features that causing
errors at vim start (comment them out).

Tested workable on the following platforms:

* **Ubuntu** 12.04, 14.04

* **RedHat** 6.7, 7.1

* **Centos** 6.7, 7.1

* **openSUSE** 13.2

* **Windows** win7

# Install and Update
## Quick Install
Auto scripts for install/uninstall, but I only tested under limited platforms:
```shell
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ArthurChiao/vim_awesome.git

$ cd vim_awesome

$ ./install.sh
```

## Custome Install
Tested on **Ubuntu/Redhat/CentOS/OpenSUSE/Windows/** platforms.

For windows users, you need a bash, such as, `cygwin`, `mingw`, or like what
I used, `git bash`, which is installed along with `git`.

```shell
# it's better to backup your old configuration files
$ cd ~ && mkdir vimback && mv .vim* vimback -rf

# clone repo
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ArthurChiao/vim_awesome.git

# copy files to home directory
$ cd vim_awesome && cp .vim_runtime ~ -rf

# install
$ sh ~/.vim_runtime/install_awesome_vimrc.sh
```

## Update
```shell
$ ./update.sh
```
This will update your vim configuration to the lasted `vim_awesome`.

## Uninstall
```shell
$ ./uninstall.sh
```
This will remove vim_awesome and restore vim to your previous configuration.


## Dependencies
Some dependencies are needed to enable the full-feature of the configuration.
You may need to install them manually if they are not there. However, you
could also choose to ignore them, just disable the features when vim report
errors at the configuration file `error: at line xxx in file xxx`.

1. Ubuntu

    the following tools are used by the configuration:

    ```shell
    # install ctags
    $ sudo apt-get install ctags

    # install vim-gtk, this enables `neocomplete`, one of the most powerful
    # auto completion plugin
    $ sudo apt-get install vim-gtk
    ```

1. RedHat & CentOS

    ```shell
    # install ctags
    $ sudo yum install ctags
    ```

1. openSUSE

    ```shell
    $ sudo zypper install ctags
    ```

1. Windows
    Download `ctags.exe`, put it into `C:\Windows\System32\`.

    `neocomplete` needs lua enabled when gvim is compiled. Otherwise, it doesn't
    work (but reports no errors).

# Plugins Management
`vim_awesome` uses pathogen to manage plugins, by which you could easily config
your plugs in [plugins.config](./plugins.config).

Example of config goes like:
```
ZIP ack.vim https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim master
ZIP bufexplorer https://github.com/corntrace/bufexplorer master
ZIP ctrlp.vim https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim master
ZIP mayansmoke https://github.com/vim-scripts/mayansmoke master
GIT nerdtree https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree master
```

`ZIP` and `GIT` indicate the way you want to download and update your plugin.
Followings are `plugin name`, `github url` and `branch name`.

More information is available in [plugins.config](./plugins.config).

# FAQ
## 1. neocomplete
If you encountered `neocomplete` problems at vim startup, it may be that
your vim version is under 7.4, or it is not `lua` enabled (test it with
`:echo has("lua")`.

To fix this problem, please see the solutions provided in
https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim.git

1. Ubuntu

    One simple/lazy solution for Ubuntu is to install `gvim`, which includes
    `lua` by default:
    ```shell
    $ sudo apt-get install vim-gtk
    ```
    Restart your vim, the `neocomplete` should be ok.

    If none of the solutions in the above link fits your case, just remove the
    `neocomplete` plugin:
    ```shell
    $ rm .vim_runtime/sources_forked/neocomplete.vim -rf
    ```
    restart the vim.

1. CentOS

    Most likely, you need to [compile vim74 from source](http://www.fullybaked.co.uk/articles/installing-latest-vim-on-centos-from-source) to get lua enabled:
    ```shell
    $ yum groupinstall 'Development tools'

    $ yum install ncurses ncurses-devel
    $ yum install lua-devel

    $ wget ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix/vim-7.4.tar.bz2
    $ tar -xjf vim-7.4.tar.bz2

    $ cd vim74
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr --with-features=huge --enable-rubyinterp --enable-pythoninterp --enable-luainterp
    $ make && make install
    ```
    Test with `:echo has("lua")`, should return 1.

## 2. can not load custom colorschemes on windows

If your `vim` on windows can not load the colorschemes in `~/.vim_runtime/colors`,
just copy them to the `<your vim install dir>/colors/`, e.g, `c:/vim74/colors/`.
Restart vim.

## 3. for python coders
If you open an existing python file, you will find that all
functions/classes are folded, it may embrass you at the scene, like the
following,

![python-mode-folding](res/python-folding.jpg)

here are some quick remedies:

* `za` - toggle to open/close current folding
* `zr` and `zm` - open/close all first-level foldings in current file
* `zR` and `zM` - open/close all foldings in current file

Or, **open the foldings with mouse**: click the `+` character on the left of each folding.

The foldings are created by `PythonMode` plugin. If you do not
like it, you could just remove it by deleting the
`~/.vim_runtime/sources_forked/python-mode/` folder on your host, and restart vim.
However, i highly recommand you to get familir with this tool, which can
accelerate your python developing by great extent.

For more commands about code folding/unfolding, see [Cheat Sheets](cheat-sheets/builtin.md#code_folding).

If your vim doesn't have python and python3 support, you may need to run [recompile_vim.sh](recompile_vim.sh) to recompile vim with full python support.
(Attention: only test on Ubuntu 16.04)
